# Day 61:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 61 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge! Today I learned about WTForms. Love the name! I practiced using WTForm by creating a basic form to "login" and see different sites depending on if the credentials where correct or not. I also learned about quick_form() and that's some serious magic working ;)
