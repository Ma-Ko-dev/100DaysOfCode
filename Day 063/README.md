# Day 63:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 63 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge! Databases! Finally some data persistence! The first few things about SQLite where kinda difficult but after we switched to SQLAlchemy everything went way smoother. I created a Site that can add, edit and delete Items from a Database and displays it.

Please be aware that i used older versions of SQLAchemy etc. Since this is was the course currently uses.
