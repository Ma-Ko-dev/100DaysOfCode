# Day 60:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 60 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge! Today's topic was how to handle POST and GET in Flask. As practice, I created a simple Form example here and refactored the day 59 Project so the contact form on the page works. NOTE: I did not implement the actual email sending since I used it so much that I dont want to send me any more Spam :D
