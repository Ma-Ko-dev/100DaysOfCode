# Day 80:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 80 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge! Todays Project was ... way above my head :D I gave it a good try for a few hours, but in the end i looked and studied the solution. So i want to be clear here: The file here is the provided solution. Data visualisation is not my strength, but i gave it a honest try and i am still glad i learned about it so i have a starting point when i need something like his.
