# Day 52:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 52 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge! Today I created an almost automatic Instagram Follower bot. It can follow the first 5 people from a selected profile and that's it. I didn't want to create a complete Follower Bot since it was just not in my interest. It is a proof of concept if you want to call it like that.
