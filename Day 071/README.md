# Day 71:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 71 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge! In Today's Lesson I learned to work more with Pandas after we had previously used Pandas only a little. I also used Googles "Colaboratory" instead of installing Anaconda/Jupyter on my machine. It's pretty nice. Not going to lie, but this is very difficult for some reason :D
