# Day 50:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 50 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge! Today's topic was to create a Tinder Account and to automate "swiping". But since I didn't want to create a Tinder profile, I revisited a previous project.

I revisited the Project from day 46: Creating a Spotify Playlist from a List of Songs. The old version just searched for the Song name which produced some interesting results. I now scraped the Artist names too and added them to the search queue. Now, the resulting Songs make more sense but the total amount of songs that got found is lower since Spotify don't have every song. But at least its more precise now! ;)
