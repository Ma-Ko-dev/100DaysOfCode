# Day 40:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 40 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge! Part 2 of the flight search project. We just added the possibility to create a google sheet with users and their email adresses. So we could send everyone from that list a email if there is a cheap flight to the destinations we have in another sheet. Also added the ability to see if we have a flight that is not direct but with an extra stop.
