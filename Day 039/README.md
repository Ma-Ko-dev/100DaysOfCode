# Day 39:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 39 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge! Created the first half of a flight price finder. Had to comment out some API calls since especially sheety only allows 200 calls a month so the script only works... a little bit. :D I also left out the notification part. In the original task i had to send SMS with the flight alert, so i left this out. I also didn't spam myself again with a lot of emails :D
