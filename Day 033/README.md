# Day 33:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 33 of the 100 Days  of Code Challenge! Today I learned about API and the requests module. As exercise, we used the Kanye Rest API and then created a program that notify us via email (in theory at least, I didn't include that) when the ISS is close to us and (maybe) visible when its nighttime.
