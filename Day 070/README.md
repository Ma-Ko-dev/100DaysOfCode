# Day 70:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 70 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge! I learned how to use Git and the Bash Console. For now, i will probably keep using just pycharm for version control but it is always good to know. Another Task was to deploy our Blog to Heroku but i skipped that since i want to upload something useful instead in the future :)
