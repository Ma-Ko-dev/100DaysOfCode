# Day 37:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 37 of the 100 Days  of Code Challenge! Today I learned more about the requests module. I used headers, learned about POST, PUT and DELETE. Unfortunately there is no real code to show, so I just post the link of my freshly created Pixela account here. We used Pixela to get familiar with the new functions today :)

I have no plans to update or use Pixela in the future. But that might change.
