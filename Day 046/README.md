# Day 46:
#100DaysOfCode

It's day 46 of the 100 Days of Code Challenge! Today I created a program that lets you input a date like YYYY-MM-DD and then uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the top 100 songs from this time. It then wants to connect to Spotify, creates a playlist and adds all songs from the time it can find on spotify to that playlist. Far from perfect, but I put it on my list of potential refactors.
